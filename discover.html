              <h2>Our Story</h2>
              <p>
                Since 1946, Aspen Snowmass has been at the forefront of mountain
                recreation and responsible tourism in Colorado. What began as a
                single ski slope on Aspen Mountain has grown into a
                world-renowned resort with four unique mountains, exceptional
                accommodations, and a commitment to sustainability that sets the
                standard for the industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our founder, Walter Paepcke, envisioned a place where visitors
                could nourish their minds, bodies, and spirits. Today, we
                continue that vision by offering not only incredible skiing and
                snowboarding but also cultural experiences, environmental
                stewardship, and community engagement.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through the decades, we've evolved and expanded, but our core
                values remain the same: to provide unforgettable mountain
                experiences while preserving the natural beauty of the Roaring
                Fork Valley for future generations.
